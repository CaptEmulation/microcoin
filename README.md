microCoin
==============
microCoin uses scrypt-jane POW mining with modified nFactor.
With the modified nFactor the coin will have a period of 1-2 weeks during which GPU mining is very fast and CPU mining slow. GPU mining will slowly decrease and after 1-2 weeks GPU mining will be around 7x slower than it was during the start of the nFactor period.
CPU mining won't be affected by the period, making CPU mining more efficient than with regular cryptocurrencies. The coin will start as a GPU-currency and shift into an effective hybrid of CPU and GPU-mineable coins in which both will be efficient.
microCoin aims to be a deflationary coin for investors. The microCoin dev team will also set bounties and seek to make services for microCoin.
microCoin can equally be used as a long-term trading instrument for investors as well as a currency for shops, games and any other services.
